# AI-Based-Personalized-Skincare-System
Skincare personalization with data-driven insights
📌 AI-Based Personalized Skincare System

🚀 Project Overview

This project is an AI-driven personalized skincare recommendation system designed to:

Collect user data through Google Forms.

Store and process data using SQL databases.

Analyze facial images and skin condition metrics.

Provide customized skincare recommendations based on user inputs.

Track stress levels (sleep quality, HRV, etc.) and correlate with skin health.

Customize formulations and ingredient percentages for direct product creation.

Support small-scale personalized skincare production without mass-market scaling.

Align with ISO 42001 & ISO 27716 standards for AI Governance and Data Privacy.

Position as a potential MVP for investor engagement.

Integrate machine learning for improved recommendations.

🎯 Objectives

Develop a structured skincare recommendation system.

Incorporate real-time skin and health data.

Enable AI-powered formulation recommendations.

Ensure compliance with ISO standards for AI Governance.

Create an investor-ready business case.

📊 Business Insights

By leveraging AI-driven analysis, this project aims to:

Identify Trends in Skin Health – Understanding seasonal and environmental impacts on skin.

Optimize Formulations – Adjust active ingredient percentages dynamically.

Predict Skincare Effectiveness – Forecast long-term effects based on AI models.

Personalize Skincare at Scale – While remaining small-batch and premium.

Ensure Ethical AI Compliance – Following ISO 42001 & ISO 27716.
